## Installation 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rosemeis/fastmixture.git
cd fastmixture
pip3 install .

# The "fastmixture" main caller will now be available
```

## Usage
`fastmixture` requires input data in binary [PLINK](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/input#bed) format. 
- Choose the value of `K` that best fits your data. We recommend performing principal component analysis (PCA) first as an exploratory analysis before running `fastmixture`.
- Use multiple seeds for your analysis to ensure robust and reliable results (e.g. â‰¥ 5).

```bash
# Using binary PLINK files for K=3
fastmixture --bfile data --K 3 --threads 32 --seed 1 --out test

# Outputs Q and P files (test.K3.s1.Q and test.K3.s1.P)
```

<!-- ## Configuration
### Number of batches
`fastmixture` utilizes a mini-batch scheme for accelerating its EM algorithm.
